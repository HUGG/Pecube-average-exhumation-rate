Pecube-average-exhumation-rate
==============================

This script reads the predicted age summary (Comparison.txt) and output Pressure-Temperature-time records for each sample (Ttpaths.txt) in Pecube and calculates the average exhumation rate corresponding to the time recorded by a given thermochronometer. The output is a csv-formatted file of sample positions, observed and predicted cooling ages, and their exhumation rates.
