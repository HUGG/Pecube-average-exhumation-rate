## Pecube-average-exhumation-rate

This script reads the predicted age summary (`Comparison.txt`) and output Pressure-Temperature-time records for each sample (`Ttpaths.txt`) in Pecube and calculates the average exhumation rate corresponding to the time recorded by a given thermochronometer.
The output is a csv-formatted file of sample positions, observed and predicted cooling ages, and their exhumation rates.
